Homework: Build a color drop down component.  The component should
display the list of colors provided by the Color enum from the GraphQL server.

{ __type(name:"Color") {
  kind
  name
  description
  enumValues {
    name
    description
    isDeprecated
    deprecationReason
  }
} }

Do not work about collecting the value.  Just build the drop down list from
the GraphQL query results.
